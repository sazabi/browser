/**
 * Resolving the intake endpoint from a single URL.
 *
 * Every other Sazabi log source is configured with one intake URL, and public
 * keys are meant to stay a low-level detail customers never handle. The key is
 * already in the URL: the intake edge reconstructs it from the hostname
 * (terraform/main/cloudfront-functions/intake-router.js), so the SDK can do the
 * same reconstruction locally and send the Bearer header itself.
 *
 * Two keyed shapes exist, matching the edge's two grammars:
 *   {hex}.{region}.intake.{domain}            — prefixless (what log sources issue)
 *   {adapter}-{hex}.{region}.intake.{domain}  — keyed-adapter (legacy, still served)
 *
 * A URL in neither shape is not an error: it may be a proxy or a custom
 * endpoint. The SDK then requires an explicit `publicKey`, so a
 * misconfiguration surfaces as a clear warning rather than silent no-auth.
